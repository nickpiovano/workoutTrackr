workoutTrackr is a workout app created for the purposes of CS 480's Final Assignment

The homepage of the app displays 7 buttons: My Profile, Workouts, Stats Tracker, Map, Nutrition, Invite a Friend and Click for Motivation. 
Below will be a description of what each button does.

My Profile:
Allows users to enter personal information (ie name, height and weight) 
and then displays the values entered in TextViews when the "Update" button is pressed.

Workouts:
Workouts displays a ListView that allows users to enter workouts. 
The workouts entered can be added, updated, deleted and the list can be saved.
When a workout is added or deleted the app utilizes text-to-speech to explain what happened.

Stats Tracker:
Stats Tracker allows users to enter their personal best ("PR") mile times and bench press maximums.
These values are then dislayed in TextViews.

Map:

When a marker on the map is pressed the user is directed to another tab with a WebView that loads a URL with infomation about the gym.

Nutrition:

Invite a Friend:
Invite a Friend prompts users to choose a method of communication to tell their friends about workoutTrackr.

Click for Motivation:
Click for Motivation prompts a notification and makes the button spin.

This app is intended to make working out easier and more enjoyable and we hope that everyone who uses it enjoys it!
